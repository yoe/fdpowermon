 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Jul 2018 13:04:16 +0200

fdpowermon (1.18) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Pass the version number of the Notify library as a string rather
    than as a number, so that it is not locale-sensitive anymore.
  * Limit the number of digits past the comma to 2 in more places.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.9.8 (no applicable changes)
  * theme.cfg, debian/fdpowermon-icons.install: update for new location of icon
    directory in oxygen-icon-theme package

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jun 2016 13:26:44 +0200

fdpowermon (1.17) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Improve accuracy of combined battery level calculation by
    incorporating battery capacity and not just percentage
  * Hide the StatusIcon when no icon is selected, rather than leaving a
    blank space.
  * Improve parsing of theme files by skipping empty lines.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jun 2016 12:55:40 +0200

fdpowermon (1.16) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Follow the XDG spec a bit better: use XDG_CONFIG_HOME if specified
    (still fall back to $HOME/.config if not, though).
  * Fix exception check in fdpowermon::theme::warning, so that we don't
    fall back to using dialogs after the first warning. Closes: #786370.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Mar 2015 09:44:35 +0100

fdpowermon (1.15) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix off-by-one in level parsing code
  * Fix language: "Compound" is an awkward replacement for combined
    battery percentage. Use "Combined" instead.
  * Switch to gtk+3

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Mar 2015 18:30:26 +0100

fdpowermon (1.14) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Move example config file to /usr/share/doc/fdpowermon, where it belongs
    (from /usr/share/fdpowermon)
  * Support multiple batteries properly.
  * debian/control: Fix Vcs-Git: URL format
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.9.6 (nothing relevant)

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Mar 2015 08:58:31 +0100

fdpowermon (1.13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * make use_notify an "our" variable, rather than a "my" one, so that
    it can actually be changed from theme files
  * move @main::warnings to @fdpowermon::theme::warnings, so the point
    at which a warning is issued can be changed as well
  * Minor documentation updates

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Apr 2014 21:49:33 +0200

fdpowermon (1.12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update description of fdpowermon package: recent versions *do* have
    more features than just showing an icon, even if they're not enabled
    by default.
  * Add example theme.pl script to explain its usage. Closes: #738983.
  * If use libnotify fails because no DBus service is running for the
    libnotify stuff to show a message, fall back to using dialog boxes,
    too. Closes bug report not received through BTS.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Feb 2014 09:40:56 +0100

fdpowermon (1.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no relevant changes)
  * Fix use of eval. Using eval to check for the presence of modules
    requires a string, not a code block. Closes: #738985.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 31 Dec 2013 11:16:56 +0100

fdpowermon (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch to 3.0 (native) format.
  * Call fdpowermon::theme::warning instead of main::warning, which no
    longer exists since 1.9. Oops. Patch by David Purton; Closes:
    #714975

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Fri, 05 Jul 2013 20:57:26 +0200

fdpowermon (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add example for perl API.
  * Move libgtk2-notify-perl to recommends
  * Introduce $fdpowermon::theme::use_notify which allows one to disable
    the use of notifications and fall back to dialog boxes (initialized
    based on whether Gtk2::Notify is installed).
  * The above two should allow fdpowermon >= 1.6 to run on distributions
    where Gtk2::Notify isn't packaged, such as Arch Linux, while also
    allowing allowing other users the added benefit of having the choice
    of maybe not using libnotify.
  * Fix an error in the manpage

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@grep.be>  Thu, 18 Apr 2013 09:59:43 +0200

fdpowermon (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support per-user themes and scripted themes, with an explicit API in
    a separate namespace. The scripted theme allows to register coderefs
    that should be called when we reach a particular battery level,
    either when charging or when discharging. Closes: #694751.
  * Add a manpage, which describes the file format for theming.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Feb 2013 10:19:48 +0100

fdpowermon (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add libgtk2-notify-perl to Depends: line, which we use since 1.6.
    Closes: #696685

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Dec 2012 10:52:05 +0100

fdpowermon (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "procrastinating sucks" release.
  * Allow more than nine steps; patch from Gregor Herrman. Closes:
    #672280.
  * Parse "battery full" state correctly. Closes: #669020
  * Use notifications rather than dialog boxes, so we don't steal the focus
    accidentally

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon, 01 Oct 2012 18:53:29 +0200

fdpowermon (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Always return 1 from checklevels(), also if we don't find any
    battery line in the acpi output, so that the main loop callback
    doesn't get stopped. Closes: #653721.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Jan 2012 01:04:29 +0100

fdpowermon (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure warning messages don't appear *all* the time (oops).
  * Update copyright file with oxygen icons' copyright, since we now
    incorporate them as well

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Jan 2012 19:37:24 +0100

fdpowermon (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix warning messages (don't use undef where we need to use a
    Gtk2::DialogFlags value). Closes: #654836.
  * Remove stray pcap file
  * Create a new package fdpowermon-icons, containing the necessary
    files from the oxygen-icon-theme package, and nothing more. Closes:
    #653811.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Jan 2012 00:10:47 +0100

fdpowermon (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Vcs-Browser header to debian/control
  * Issue appropriate warnings at power levels of 10, 5, and 1%.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Dec 2011 14:29:32 +0100

fdpowermon (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't forget about the icons... d'uh

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Sat, 02 Jul 2011 10:38:58 +0200

fdpowermon (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Fri, 01 Jul 2011 19:59:09 +0200
