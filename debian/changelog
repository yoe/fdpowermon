fdpowermon (1.12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update description of fdpowermon package: recent versions *do* have
    more features than just showing an icon, even if they're not enabled
    by default.
  * Add example theme.pl script to explain its usage. Closes: #738983.
  * If use libnotify fails because no DBus service is running for the
    libnotify stuff to show a message, fall back to using dialog boxes,
    too. Closes bug report not received through BTS.

fdpowermon (1.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no relevant changes)
  * Fix use of eval. Using eval to check for the presence of modules
    requires a string, not a code block. Closes: #738985.

fdpowermon (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch to 3.0 (native) format.
  * Call fdpowermon::theme::warning instead of main::warning, which no
    longer exists since 1.9. Oops. Patch by David Purton; Closes:
    #714975

fdpowermon (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add example for perl API.
  * Move libgtk2-notify-perl to recommends
  * Introduce $fdpowermon::theme::use_notify which allows one to disable
    the use of notifications and fall back to dialog boxes (initialized
    based on whether Gtk2::Notify is installed).
  * The above two should allow fdpowermon >= 1.6 to run on distributions
    where Gtk2::Notify isn't packaged, such as Arch Linux, while also
    allowing allowing other users the added benefit of having the choice
    of maybe not using libnotify.
  * Fix an error in the manpage

fdpowermon (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support per-user themes and scripted themes, with an explicit API in
    a separate namespace. The scripted theme allows to register coderefs
    that should be called when we reach a particular battery level,
    either when charging or when discharging. Closes: #694751.
  * Add a manpage, which describes the file format for theming.

fdpowermon (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add libgtk2-notify-perl to Depends: line, which we use since 1.6.
    Closes: #696685

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Dec 2012 10:52:05 +0100

fdpowermon (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "procrastinating sucks" release.
  * Allow more than nine steps; patch from Gregor Herrman. Closes:
    #672280.
  * Parse "battery full" state correctly. Closes: #669020
  * Use notifications rather than dialog boxes, so we don't steal the focus
    accidentally

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon, 01 Oct 2012 18:53:29 +0200

fdpowermon (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Always return 1 from checklevels(), also if we don't find any
    battery line in the acpi output, so that the main loop callback
    doesn't get stopped. Closes: #653721.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Jan 2012 01:04:29 +0100

fdpowermon (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure warning messages don't appear *all* the time (oops).
  * Update copyright file with oxygen icons' copyright, since we now
    incorporate them as well

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Jan 2012 19:37:24 +0100

fdpowermon (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix warning messages (don't use undef where we need to use a
    Gtk2::DialogFlags value). Closes: #654836.
  * Remove stray pcap file
  * Create a new package fdpowermon-icons, containing the necessary
    files from the oxygen-icon-theme package, and nothing more. Closes:
    #653811.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Jan 2012 00:10:47 +0100

fdpowermon (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Vcs-Browser header to debian/control
  * Issue appropriate warnings at power levels of 10, 5, and 1%.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Dec 2011 14:29:32 +0100

fdpowermon (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't forget about the icons... d'uh

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Sat, 02 Jul 2011 10:38:58 +0200

fdpowermon (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
